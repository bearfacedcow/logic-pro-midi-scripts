Some MIDI Effects Scripts for Logic Pro X

Usage is rather simple: just open the Scripter MIDI Effect Plug-in and copy one of the scripts into the scipting window and save it in your Logic Pro X project.

That's it!

Hope you enjoy and may you make some geeky beautiful music!

Licensing is whatever open source licensing. It's JavaScript and I know I wrote these scripts. Just make some freakin' music with it and if you like it, give me a shout out!
